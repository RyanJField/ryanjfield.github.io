        abstract = {Background:
Since 2015, the Complex Reviews Synthesis Unit (CRSU) has developed a suite of web-based applications (apps) that conduct complex evidence synthesis meta-analyses through point-and-click interfaces. This has been achieved in the R programming language by combining existing R packages that conduct meta-analysis with the shiny web-application package. The CRSU apps have evolved from two short-term student projects into a suite of eight apps that are used for more than 3,000 h per month.

Aim:
Here, we present our experience of developing production grade web-apps from the point-of-view of individuals trained primarily as statisticians rather than software developers in the hopes of encouraging and inspiring other groups to develop valuable open-source statistical software whilst also learning from our experiences.

Key challenges:
We discuss how we have addressed challenges to research software development such as responding to feedback from our real-world users to improve the CRSU apps, the implementation of software engineering principles into our app development process and gaining recognition for non-traditional research work within the academic environment.

Future developments:
The CRSU continues to seek funding opportunities both to maintain and further develop our shiny apps. We aim to increase our user base by implementing new features within the apps and building links with other groups developing complementary evidence synthesis tools.},

        abstract = {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses play a crucial role in clinical research by providing a means of evaluating the effectiveness of interventions in situations of uncertainty. Pairwise meta-analysis, which is the most widely used method, compares active interventions to placebos or other treatments. However, this approach has limitations in its ability to assess multiple interventions simultaneously, making it less suitable for comprehensive decision-making. This is where Network Meta-analysis (NMA) comes in, which extends pairwise meta-analysis to allow for the assessment of more than two interventions within a single analysis, even when direct head-to-head comparisons are not available. NMA shares similarities with pairwise meta-analysis, including systematic literature searches, bias assessment, data extraction, and statistical pooling. Two critical assumptions underlie NMA: transitivity and consistency. NMA can be performed using frequentist or Bayesian approaches, with both fixed and random effects models. Recent developments such as population adjustment methods and Component NMA have enhanced its utility. The significant advantage of NMA is its ability to generate treatment rankings based on the probability of each treatment being the most effective. Web-based applications such as MetaInsight and NMA Studio simplify the NMA process, making it more accessible without coding skills. NMA is essential in evidence-based decision-making, providing comprehensive comparisons of multiple interventions, overcoming the limitations of pairwise meta-analysis. While challenges persist, transparency is maintained, and decision-making bodies recognize NMA's value. NMA is a powerful tool that defines the future of healthcare decision-making.},

        abstract = {Background: 
Joint modelling combines two or more statistical models to reduce bias and increase efficiency. As the use of joint modelling increases it is important to understand how and why it is being applied to heart failure research.

Methods: 
A systematic review of major medical databases of studies which used joint modelling within heart failure alongside an exemplar; joint modelling repeat measurements of serum digoxin with all-cause mortality using data from the Effect of Digoxin on Mortality and Morbidity in Patients with Heart Failure (DIG) trial.

Results: 
Overall, 28 studies were included that used joint models, 25 (89\%) used data from cohort studies, the remaining 3 (11\%) using data from clinical trials. 21 (75\%) of the studies used biomarkers and the remaining studies used imaging parameters and functional parameters. The exemplar findings show that a per unit increase of square root serum digoxin is associated with the hazard of all-cause mortality increasing by 1.77 (1.34?2.33) times when adjusting for clinically relevant covariates.

Conclusion: 
Recently, there has been a rise in publications of joint modelling being applied to heart failure. Where appropriate, joint models should be preferred over traditional models allowing for the inclusion of repeated measures while accounting for the biological nature of biomarkers and measurement error.},

Rapidly evolving data, such as data streams changing during a disease outbreak, are particularly challenging. Data management is further complicated by data being imprecisely identified when used. Public trust in policy decisions resulting from such analyses is easily damaged and is often low, with cynicism arising where claims of ?following the science? are made without accompanying evidence. Tracing the provenance of such decisions back through open software to primary data would clarify this evidence, enhancing the transparency of the decision-making process. Here, we demonstrate a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data pipeline. Although developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, it allows easy annotation of any data as they are consumed by analyses, or conversely traces the provenance of scientific outputs back through the analytical or modelling source code to primary data. Such a tool provides a mechanism for the public, and fellow scientists, to better assess scientific evidence by inspecting its provenance, while allowing scientists to support policymakers in openly justifying their decisions. We believe that such tools should be promoted for use across all areas of policy-facing research.

        abstract = {Background: 
Following the initial identification of the 2019 coronavirus disease (covid-19), the subsequent months saw substantial increases in published biomedical research. Concerns have been raised in both scientific and lay press around the quality of some of this research. We assessed clinical research from major clinical journals, comparing methodological and reporting quality of covid-19 papers published in the first wave (here defined as December 2019 to May 2020 inclusive) of the viral pandemic with non-covid papers published at the same time.

Methods: 
We reviewed research publications (print and online) from The BMJ, Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), The Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine, from first publication of a covid-19 research paper (February 2020) to May 2020 inclusive. Paired reviewers were randomly allocated to extract data on methodological quality (risk of bias) and reporting quality (adherence to reporting guidance) from each paper using validated assessment tools. A random 10\% of papers were assessed by a third, independent rater. Overall methodological quality for each paper was rated high, low or unclear. Reporting quality was described as percentage of total items reported.

Results: 
From 168 research papers, 165 were eligible, including 54 (33\%) papers with a covid-19 focus. For methodological quality, 18 (33\%) covid-19 papers and 83 (73\%) non-covid papers were rated as low risk of bias, OR 6.32 (95\%CI 2.85 to 14.00). The difference in quality was maintained after adjusting for publication date, results, funding, study design, journal and raters (OR 6.09 (95\%CI 2.09 to 17.72)). For reporting quality, adherence to reporting guidelines was poorer for covid-19 papers, mean percentage of total items reported 72\% (95\%CI:66 to 77) for covid-19 papers and 84\% (95\%CI:81 to 87) for non-covid.

Conclusions: 
Across various measures, we have demonstrated that covid-19 research from the first wave of the pandemic was potentially of lower quality than contemporaneous non-covid research. While some differences may be an inevitable consequence of conducting research during a viral pandemic, poor reporting should not be accepted.},

             url = {https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/226650/},
        abstract = {Background:
Alcohol consumption is a leading contributor to death and disability worldwide, but previous research has not examined the effects of different patterns of alcohol consumption. The study objective was to understand the relationship between different alcohol consumption patterns and adverse health outcomes risk, adjusting for average amount consumed among regular drinkers.

Methods:
This was a prospective cohort study of UK Biobank (UKB) participants. Abstainers, infrequent alcohol consumers or those with previous cancer, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or liver cirrhosis were excluded. We used beverage type, consumption with food and consumption frequency as exposures and adjusted for potential confounding. All-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events-MACE (MI/stroke/cardiovascular death), accidents/injuries, liver cirrhosis, all-cause and alcohol-related cancer incidence over 9-year median follow-up period were outcomes of interest.

Results:
The final sample size for analysis was N = 309,123 (61.5\% of UKB sample). Spirit drinking was associated with higher adjusted mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.25; 95\% confidence intervals (CI) 1.14?1.38), MACE (HR 1.31; 95\% CI 1.15?1.50), cirrhosis (HR 1.48; 95\% CI 1.08?2.03) and accident/injuries (HR 1.10; 95\% CI 1.03?1.19) risk compared to red wine drinking, after adjusting for the average weekly alcohol consumption amounts. Beer/cider drinkers were also at a higher risk of mortality (HR 1.18; 95\% CI 1.10?1.27), MACE (HR 1.16; 95\% CI 1.05?1.27), cirrhosis (HR 1.36; 95\% CI 1.06?1.74) and accidents/injuries (HR 1.11; 95\% CI 1.06?1.17). Alcohol consumption without food was associated with higher adjusted mortality (HR 1.10; 95\% CI 1.02?1.17) risk, compared to consumption with food. Alcohol consumption over 1?2 times/week had higher adjusted mortality (HR 1.09; 95\% CI 1.03?1.16) and MACE (HR 1.14; 95\% CI 1.06?1.23) risk, compared to 3?4 times/week, adjusting for the amount of alcohol consumed.

Conclusion:
Red wine drinking, consumption with food and spreading alcohol intake over 3?4 days were associated with lower risk of mortality and vascular events among regular alcohol drinkers, after adjusting for the effects of average amount consumed. Selection bias and residual confounding are important possible limitations. These findings, if replicated and validated, have the potential to influence policy and practice advice on less harmful patterns of alcohol consumption.},
