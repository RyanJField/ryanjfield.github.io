abstract: Modern epidemiological analyses to understand and combat the spread of disease
  depend critically on access to, and use of, data. Rapidly evolving data, such as
  data streams changing during a disease outbreak, are particularly challenging. Data
  management is further complicated by data being imprecisely identified when used.
  Public trust in policy decisions resulting from such analyses is easily damaged
  and is often low, with cynicism arising where claims of ?following the science?
  are made without accompanying evidence. Tracing the provenance of such decisions
  back through open software to primary data would clarify this evidence, enhancing
  the transparency of the decision-making process. Here, we demonstrate a Findable,
  Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data pipeline. Although developed
  during the COVID-19 pandemic, it allows easy annotation of any data as they are
  consumed by analyses, or conversely traces the provenance of scientific outputs
  back through the analytical or modelling source code to primary data. Such a tool
  provides a mechanism for the public, and fellow scientists, to better assess scientific
  evidence by inspecting its provenance, while allowing scientists to support policymakers
  in openly justifying their decisions. We believe that such tools should be promoted
  for use across all areas of policy-facing research.  This article is part of the
  theme issue ?Technical challenges of modelling real-life epidemics and examples
  of overcoming these?.
