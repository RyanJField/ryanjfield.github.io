abstract: 'Background: Since 2015, the Complex Reviews Synthesis Unit (CRSU) has developed
  a suite of web-based applications (apps) that conduct complex evidence synthesis
  meta-analyses through point-and-click interfaces. This has been achieved in the
  R programming language by combining existing R packages that conduct meta-analysis
  with the shiny web-application package. The CRSU apps have evolved from two short-term
  student projects into a suite of eight apps that are used for more than 3,000 h
  per month.  Aim: Here, we present our experience of developing production grade
  web-apps from the point-of-view of individuals trained primarily as statisticians
  rather than software developers in the hopes of encouraging and inspiring other
  groups to develop valuable open-source statistical software whilst also learning
  from our experiences.  Key challenges: We discuss how we have addressed challenges
  to research software development such as responding to feedback from our real-world
  users to improve the CRSU apps, the implementation of software engineering principles
  into our app development process and gaining recognition for non-traditional research
  work within the academic environment.  Future developments: The CRSU continues to
  seek funding opportunities both to maintain and further develop our shiny apps.
  We aim to increase our user base by implementing new features within the apps and
  building links with other groups developing complementary evidence synthesis tools.'
