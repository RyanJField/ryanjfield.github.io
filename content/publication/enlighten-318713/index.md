abstract: "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses play a crucial role in clinical research
  by providing a means of evaluating the effectiveness of interventions in situations
  of uncertainty. Pairwise meta-analysis, which is the most widely used method, compares
  active interventions to placebos or other treatments. However, this approach has
  limitations in its ability to assess multiple interventions simultaneously, making
  it less suitable for comprehensive decision-making. This is where Network Meta-analysis
  (NMA) comes in, which extends pairwise meta-analysis to allow for the assessment
  of more than two interventions within a single analysis, even when direct head-to-head
  comparisons are not available. NMA shares similarities with pairwise meta-analysis,
  including systematic literature searches, bias assessment, data extraction, and
  statistical pooling. Two critical assumptions underlie NMA: transitivity and consistency.
  NMA can be performed using frequentist or Bayesian approaches, with both fixed and
  random effects models. Recent developments such as population adjustment methods
  and Component NMA have enhanced its utility. The significant advantage of NMA is
  its ability to generate treatment rankings based on the probability of each treatment
  being the most effective. Web-based applications such as MetaInsight and NMA Studio
  simplify the NMA process, making it more accessible without coding skills. NMA is
  essential in evidence-based decision-making, providing comprehensive comparisons
  of multiple interventions, overcoming the limitations of pairwise meta-analysis.
  While challenges persist, transparency is maintained, and decision-making bodies
  recognize NMA's value. NMA is a powerful tool that defines the future of healthcare
  decision-making."
