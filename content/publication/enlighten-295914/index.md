abstract: 'Background:  Joint modelling combines two or more statistical models to
  reduce bias and increase efficiency. As the use of joint modelling increases it
  is important to understand how and why it is being applied to heart failure research.  Methods:  A
  systematic review of major medical databases of studies which used joint modelling
  within heart failure alongside an exemplar; joint modelling repeat measurements
  of serum digoxin with all-cause mortality using data from the Effect of Digoxin
  on Mortality and Morbidity in Patients with Heart Failure (DIG) trial.  Results:  Overall,
  28 studies were included that used joint models, 25 (89%) used data from cohort
  studies, the remaining 3 (11%) using data from clinical trials. 21 (75%) of the
  studies used biomarkers and the remaining studies used imaging parameters and functional
  parameters. The exemplar findings show that a per unit increase of square root serum
  digoxin is associated with the hazard of all-cause mortality increasing by 1.77
  (1.34?2.33) times when adjusting for clinically relevant covariates.  Conclusion:  Recently,
  there has been a rise in publications of joint modelling being applied to heart
  failure. Where appropriate, joint models should be preferred over traditional models
  allowing for the inclusion of repeated measures while accounting for the biological
  nature of biomarkers and measurement error.'
